# Todo App Microfrontend

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server

## Features

- Add new todos
- Toggle todos as completed or incomplete
- Persist todos using localStorage

## Testing

Run `npm test` to execute unit tests.

## Design Considerations

- The application is built as a microfrontend, making it easy to integrate into various host applications.
- TypeScript is used for type safety and maintainability.
- LocalStorage is used for persistence.
- Basic, functional styling is applied.
